# ================================
# This file is part of the **second part of the assignment**.
# It defines a Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) template for the dev environments.
# - Targets the toolset-${DEPLOY_ID} deployment
# - Scales pods based on CPU utilization
# - minReplicas / maxReplicas and target CPU can be customized
# This file is provided as a template only and is NOT deployed in this submission.
